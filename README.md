# Marketing_Campaign_Mailer
It is to work and explore about sending bulk emails. How it works and as a proof of concept.
We can send bulk emails. 

API : /campaign/sendBulkEmail
payload: {
    "emailFrom": "", // your email from which you wish to send email
    "passCode": "", // your mail app password
    "emailTo": "", // your recipients
    "subject": "this is test email for POC"
}

Step 1:
you need to create your mail app password from which you are going to call the api.
